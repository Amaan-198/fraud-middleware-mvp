# Score thresholds for decision codes
thresholds:
  allow: 0.35      # Code 0: Allow (score < 0.35)
  monitor: 0.55    # Code 1: Allow + Monitor (0.35 ≤ score < 0.55)
  stepup: 0.75     # Code 2: Step-up Auth (0.55 ≤ score < 0.75)
  review: 0.90     # Code 4: Block (score ≥ 0.90)
  # Code 3 (Review) is for 0.75 ≤ score < 0.90

# Context-based overrides
overrides:
  high_amount: 5000.0      # Amount threshold for special handling
  trust_bypass: 0.8        # Trust score to bypass some checks

# Cost parameters for threshold optimization
costs:
  false_positive: 5.0   # $5 customer friction cost
  false_negative: 200.0 # $200 fraud loss cost
